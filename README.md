pybinpack
=========

A collection of bin-packing heuristics for Python.

TODO
====

 * Add more heuristics.
 * Write optimised solutions (both space and time).
 * Include more documentation.
 * Add support for multi-dimensional packing (will require a lot of work)
 * Add online packing heuristics
 * Consider adding support for variable bin sizes (this may require a custom type with a 'size' attribute).
 * Ship the test unit(s) in main.py elsewhere.
